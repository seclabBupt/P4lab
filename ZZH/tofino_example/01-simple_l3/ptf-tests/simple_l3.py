PTF foundational class for simple_l3.p4

This module contains the P4ProgramTest class specifically taylored for 
simple_l3 program (eventually this tayloring will go away).

All individual tests are subclassed from the this base (P4ProgramTest) or 
its ssubclasses if necessary.

The easiest way to write a test for simple_l3 is to start with a line

from simple_l3 import *
