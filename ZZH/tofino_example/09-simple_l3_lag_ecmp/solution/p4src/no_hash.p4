 * no_hash.p4
 * 
 * This file is intended to be included by simple_l3_lag_ecmp.p4 and provides
 * no hash calculation. Rather it returns a constant value. You can use this 
 * file as a stub to define your own algorithm or for debug.
 *
 * The hash module is supposed to define the following:
 *  1) Controls that will be called from the ingress() control to calculate
 *     hash. If they are not needed, then they should be empty
 *     1) calc_ipv4_hashes() -- called for IPv4 packets only
 *     2) calc_ipv6_hashes() -- called for IPv6 packets only
 *     3) calc_common_hashes() -- called for all packets 
 *
 *  2) Optionally: SCRAMBLER_ENABLE
